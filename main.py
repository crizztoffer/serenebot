        - "busted a nut so hard, they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "burped so loud, they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "rocketed right into their face—so hard that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "crossed over the great divide, gave Jesus a high five, and flew back down with such velocity, that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "told such a bad joke that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "whispered so quietly that they [verb_past_tense]"
