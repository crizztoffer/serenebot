        For the nouns, ensure a wide variety in concept, avoiding overly common or generic terms. Prioritize nouns that evoke a sense of character or object in a fantastical or humorous setting.

        For the verbs, they should describe a direct, completed action or reaction. They should be suitable for both an infinitive context (e.g., "loved to [verb]") and a simple past tense context (e.g., "they [verb]").
        Consider the following types of phrases where the verbs will be inserted, ensuring the BASE verb would make sense:
        - "who loved to [verb]"
        - "that hated to [verb]"
        - "who used to [verb]"
        - "that preferred to [verb]"

        - "with a thumpâ€”they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "so fast, they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "so hard, they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "so loud, they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "so hard that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "gave Jesus a high five, and flew back down with such velocity, that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "told such a bad joke that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "whispered so quietly that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "pissed so loudly that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "took a cock so big that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "put their thing down, flipped it, and reversed it so perfectly, that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "waffle-spanked a vagrant so hard that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "kissed Crizz P. so fast that he [verb_past_tense]"
        - "ate a dong so long that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "spun around so fast that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "vomitted so loudly that they [verb_past_tense]"
        - "sand-blasted out a power-shart so strong, that they [verb_past_tense]"

        Avoid verbs that imply a state of being (e.g., "be", "seem"), a continuous action (e.g., "running"), or require complex objects/prepositions to make sense in these contexts. Focus on verbs that are direct and complete actions.
